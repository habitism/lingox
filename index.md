If you want to learn English through Chinese, `LingoX` might be able to help you.

## Principle

Language is the shell of thought, and thought is the core of language.

If you can express your ideas in Chinese, you can quickly learn to express them in other languages. This is because when you can express your ideas, you have already understood various abstract nouns and have a certain ability for logical reasoning. Expressing in Chinese is just one form of thought expression, and thought can be expressed through different languages.

Language can be compared to musical instruments, and thought can be compared to music theory.

Music theory remains the same, but the use of musical instruments varies. Even if you are very good at playing the piano, if you have never learned to play the guitar, you will not play it well. Those who understand music theory can learn musical instruments quickly because the knowledge of music theory is already well-internalized, and practicing another musical instrument is just a matter of getting the muscles used to another tool.

Learning a new language is like learning a new musical instrument.

Once you can express your ideas fluently in Chinese, it means you have mastered the descriptive and reasoning abilities of thought expression. Then, asking you to express your ideas in English is nothing more than asking you to use another set of pronunciation skills and grammatical rules to express the content.

Next are the specific steps for learning English.

## 1. Master Phonetics

If you want to learn English, start by learning the phonetics of English.

This learning process should not exceed one week.

## 2. Express in Chinese

Each idea is unfolded in the form of a `topic`.

In `LingoX`, you can create a new note and write down what you want to say in Chinese. If you really don't know what to write, try describing your life trajectory, also known as a diary of daily events.

When recording, pay attention to breaking it into multiple paragraphs, each paragraph being a practice unit, and each paragraph should not exceed 5 sentences.

## 3. Translate Notes

Each note provides a translation function.

After finishing your note, you can enter the practice phase.

You can click `Translate`, and at this point, the AI will help you translate your content into English.

After clicking on the translation, the system will recite it, and you can practice pronunciation along with the system.

You can also modify the translation.

## 4. Understand Details

During the process of following the recitation, if you do not understand some words or grammar:

- Those with a solid vocabulary use an electronic dictionary.
- Those with a weak vocabulary use vocabulary learning software.

If you don't understand the grammar, ask ChatGPT or KIMI.

## 5. Practice Duration

When you express your ideas in English, you are using a tool, not learning a tool.

Practice is the best teacher. At first, you may feel a bit uncomfortable and often rely on tools like ChatGPT. But soon you will find that English has many repetitive patterns, and the frequency of using ChatGPT will become lower and lower, and your confidence will become stronger and stronger, because using English itself is a process of continuously verifying its effectiveness.

Within three months, you will fall in love with expressing yourself in English.
